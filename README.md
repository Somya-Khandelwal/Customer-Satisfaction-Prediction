# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. 

Unhappy customers don't stick around. 

What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.


In this project, I have worked with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.
The dataset which was provided contained many numeric variables. The "TARGET" column is the variable to predict. It equals 1 for unsatisfied customers and 0 for satisfied customers.
The task is to predict the probability of each customer in the test set being unsatisfied.
